# Quick How to

> Pick 3-10 different colours - **TRY** to create some visualisation, If the colours don't work after all, **JUST CHANGE THEM**.

# Four different approaches

1. Prepare for everything: [[City Intelligence Data Design Guidelines]]
2. Fewer hues, more shades: FT, Economist
3. More hues, fewer shades
4. Minimalist

# Prepare for Everything: very flexible palette

^0c1ff2

- example: [[City Intelligence Data Design Guidelines]]
- reason: Cover every use case
- ==[[Hues are almost always defined to be used in a certain order]]== (2 colours for City of London)

# The Brand-ist: fewer hues, more shades

^c7b86a

- example: [[The Economist visual style guide]], [[Financial Times]]

**Colour brings life to chart - But too many colours can distract**
> Design director at Pew Research, Peter Bell, explained to me two years ago why the palette was that limited: “Our internal guidance is that ‘while color brings life to charts, too many colors can distract from the data. The best approach is to use shades of a single hue in most charts.’

# More hues, fewer shades
- example: The Times(6 hues)
- This approach makes visualisations look more colourful than the brand-ist approach.
  - compare with [[#^c7b86a|Brand-ist Approach]]

# Minimal: Very limited colour palette

- example: McKensey(blue + neighbouring hues, eg purple)
> Using only a small part of the colour wheel or only a few hues for lots of categories can bring problems with accessibility
  - [[Using a few hues for lots of categories can bring problems with accessibility]]



# Which colour to define?

also see outline: [[Question - How to create or design a good colour palette?]]

- paraphrase by me: it means which colour palette type to define in the style guide: eg sequential, categorical, divergent

## Categories

### Hues - Colour for categories 

  see: [[Use different hues to distinguish categories - Categorical colours]]

### Shades - Colour for categories/sub categories

see: [[Also create lighter-darker version for a hue]]

also: [[How to create a colour scale for an arbitrary main colour by City of London Style Guide]]

### Colour for common categories

https://blog.datawrapper.de/colors-for-data-vis-style-guides/#:~:text=colors%20to%20define-,Colors%20for%20common%20categories,-If%20you%20find

eg male-female, missing data, positive-negative

## Accent colours

- "primary colour" of the chart
- An accent colour is used for ==charts that just show one colour==.
- “If more than one colour may be used to represent data, use one of the pre-defined categorical colour combos.” [Datawrapper](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colors-for-data-vis-style-guides/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20more%20than%20one%20color%20may%20be%20used%20to%20represent%20data%2C%20use%20one%20of%20the%20pre%2Ddefined%20categorical%20color%20combos.%E2%80%9D)

## Sequential and Diverging colours

- see: [[How to create a colour scale for an arbitrary main colour by City of London Style Guide]]

Diverging colour palette is basically 2 sequential scales glued together.
