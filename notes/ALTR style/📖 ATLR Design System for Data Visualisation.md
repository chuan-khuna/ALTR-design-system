# Goal/Motto/Zen of My Data Visualisation

- Design for digital first
- Accessibility
- [[The fundamental goal of data visualisations is communication with a mass audience]]
- Consistency: [[A design system is about being consistency]]

# Alignment

- [[Use a few point of alignment as possible]]

# Colour

- [[How to create a colour scale for an arbitrary main colour by City of London Style Guide]]
- My colour palette is inspired from the brand-ist type: eg [[Financial Times]] and [[The Economist]]
- fewer hues, more shades
- [ ] categorical colours 2-3 hues from accent colours (+ extra secondary 2-3 hues)
- [ ] accent colour
- [ ] shades (+/- 2)
- [ ] grey scale

# Font

- [[Most of text should be readable without zooming]]
- [[ALTR Typography and chart elements scale]]
- [[Also consider numbers when choosing fonts - tabular numerals aka monospaced numerals]]

# Anatomy

- [[Render charts using high resolution (dpi) but it also depends on figure width and height (inch)]]
- [[Use 32pt top left chart tag or 10% of chart width]]
