> When you’re creating hues, it makes sense to immediately think about lighter and darker versions of these hues too. You’ll need these shades for [less highlighted parts](https://blog.datawrapper.de/quantitative-vs-qualitative-color-scales/#4-Use-shades-to-distinguish-between-highlighted-and-unhighlighted-areas), to [emphasize an underlying order](https://blog.datawrapper.de/quantitative-vs-qualitative-color-scales/#2-Use-shades-to-emphasize-an-underlying-order), or to [distinguish between subcategories](https://blog.datawrapper.de/quantitative-vs-qualitative-color-scales/#3-Use-shades-to-distinguish-between-subcategories).

When you go lighter, consider decreasing the saturation.== [Datawrapper](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colors-for-data-vis-style-guides/#:~:text=When%20you%20go%20darker%2C%20try%20to%20increase%20the%20saturation%20of%20your%20colors.%20You%20might%20even%20need%20to%20shift%20the%20hue%20a%20little%20bit%20to%20make%20them%20work.%20When%20you%20go%20lighter%2C%20consider%20decreasing%20the%20saturation.)
