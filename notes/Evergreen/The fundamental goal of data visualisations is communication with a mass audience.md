By John Burn-Murdoch FT

**The focus on understanding is because I see data visualisation as being fundamentally about conveying information to people.** (John Burn-Murdoch)

**Visualisation is merely a procedure, a way of using that middleman to communicate ideas that convey much more than just pictures of statistics.** (p 224 HBR Goodchart)
